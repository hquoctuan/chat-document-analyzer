# Chat Document Analyzer 





## ðŸŒŸ Introduction 
Document Analyzer is a personal project that applies the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to build a chatbot capable of analyzing and conversing based on the content of user-uploaded documents.

Users can upload files such as PDF, CSV and the system will:

- Extract and process the document content.

- Generate embeddings for semantic search and retrieval.

- Analyze, summarize, or answer questions based on the documentâ€™s information.

This project is developed as a non-commercial initiative to explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with user-provided data , featuring a lightweight, extensible architecture suitable for learning, experimentation, or demo purposes.
